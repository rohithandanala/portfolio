        >I am an AI/ML engineer, data scientist, and full-stack developer with a
        passion for building intelligent systems and scalable applications. With
        a master's in Data Science, I specialize in deep learning, reinforcement
        learning, and generative models. I have hands-on experience in
        full-stack development, CI/CD, and cloud deployment with AWS. Currently,
        I'm developing an internal platform for my business, managing 100+
        AI-driven projects annually. My love for space and innovation drives me
        to push the boundaries of AI and technology.</a
